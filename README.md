A code to generate openings based on chess engines.

While it did say Stockfish and lc0, you could adapt these to any engine and does not link to these engines in any way.
So, this can be licensed under Apache-2.0 license. Users are expected to supply their own chess engine paths. 
The engines remain GPL-licensed.
